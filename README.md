- 👋 Hi, I’m @schleckiechan
- 👀 I recently got interested in coding. Currently I'm focusing on Python but I aim to learn web development as well. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python on the Sololearn platform.
- 💞️ I haven't gotten past the skript kiddy status in programming but I am very competent when it comes to translating English, German, and Mandarin in any combination :) 
- 📫 You can reach me on GitHub or on LinkedIn <href> <a> https://www.linkedin.com/in/carsten-wendler-326881182/ </a> </href>
